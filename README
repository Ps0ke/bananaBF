WHAT IS bananaBF?
A brainfuck interpreter.


BUILDING
On UNIX simply type (you need to authenticate you, this
installation installs to /usr/bin, I provide a make clean,
too!):
$ make
$ sudo make install

On other operating systems use any standard C compiler.
Build the banana binary from the main.c


USAGE
$ banana [-b] [brainfuck code file]

Only the brainfuck operators (< > , . [ ] - +) will be
interpreted. "-d" enables debugging information.


WHAT IS BRAINFUCK?
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that only
uses eight characters: + - < > [ ] , .
Brainfuck is Turing complete and extreme minimalistic.


WHY IS IT CALLED banana?
While I came up with the idea of writing a brainfuck
interpreter, i ate a banana. It starts with the same
letter -> win!


LIMITS
The number of cells is limited to the memory of your
computer. Only needed memory is allocated. Each cell
can contain a value in standard integer size. This
depends of your OS but is probably 2E32-1.The number of
commands is limited by a buffersize defined in prepro-
cessor. Default is 1024 characters. If you have a bigger
sourcefile, you need to change the constant and recompile.
You can only nest 2E32-1 loops, again, this is an integer
sized counter.
